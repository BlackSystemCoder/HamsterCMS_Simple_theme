# HamsterCMS_Simple_theme

![this is what theme looks like](https://github.com/turboblack/HamsterCMS_Simple_theme/blob/main/simple.png)

To use a template, create an **Simple** folder in the **templates** folder, paste theme file there, open the admin panel on the hosting, select the page, and specify this template in the options.

I invite you to visit the hosting that runs on this CMS

http://w10.host

works with both old and new technologies, and backward compatible

Enjoy your use.
